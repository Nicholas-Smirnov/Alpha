# Alpha Coding

## What is Alpha Coding?

Alpha is a programming language that is built fully on discord. This discord bot can be found [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=833746120462041109&permissions=8&scope=bot)

This is a programming language that is fully run on discord! 
This is a very fun and relatively simple programming language!
Let's get started.

## Getting Started

### Setting Everything Up

In order to get started with programming on Alpha, you need the programming bot in any discord server.
It is recommended for up to 2 people, otherwise, it might be a little chaotic.
The discord bot can again found be in this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=833746120462041109&permissions=8&scope=bot)

### Getting Started

As in discord, bots have a special prefix in order to activate them, for Alpha Coding, it is like so:

```
AlphaCode ==> FunctionName
```

For example, if you want to run the code, you would do it like so:

```
AlphaCode ==> RunCode
```

The same exact thing would happen if you would want to clear all previous messages or code:

```
AlphaCode ==> ClearCode
```

In order to physically start coding, you will need to use 3 of backticks, or the key above your tab key with a wavey sign and a dash. The dash is called a backtick. In order to start coding you will need to format your code to be something like this:

```
AlphaCode ==> RunCode ```

//Code will go here ```
```
This will therefore beat
